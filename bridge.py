    Single Responsibility Principle: Bridge method clearly follows the Single Responsibility principle as it decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    Open/Closed Principle: It does not violate the Open/Closed principle because at any time we can introduce the new abstractions and implementations independently form each other
    Platform independent feature: Bridge Method can be easily used for implementing the platform independent features.

Disadvantages

    Complexity: Our code might become complexive after applying Bridge method because we are introding new abstarction classes and interfaces.
    Double Indirection: Bridge method might have slight negative impact on the preformance because the abstraction needs to pass messages along with the implementator for the operation to get executed.
    Interfaces with only single implementation: If we have only limited interfaces, then it doesnâ€™t sweat a breath but if you have an exploded set of interfaces with minimal or only one implementation it becomes hard to manage

Applicability

    Run-time Binding: Generally Bridge method is used to provide the run-time binding of the implementation, here run-time binding refers to that we can call a method at run-time instead of compile-time.
    Mapping classes: Bridge method is used to map the orthogonal class hierarchies
    UI Environment: A real life application of Bridge method is used in the definition of shapes in an UI Environment
